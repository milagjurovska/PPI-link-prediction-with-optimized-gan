# Hyperparameter tuning using bio-inspired algorithms in GCN and GAN models for link prediction in a PPI network 

This project is made to compare different biologically inspired algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization in hyperparameter tuning in Graph Convolutional Network and Generative Adversarial Network models for link prediction in a <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10000/10000-PP-Pathways.html">SNAPS protein-protein interaction network</a>.
