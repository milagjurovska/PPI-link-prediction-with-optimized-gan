# Hyperparameter tuning using bio-inspired algorithms in a GCN model for link prediction in a PPI network 

This project is made to compare different biologically inspired algortihms like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization in hyperparameter tuning in a GCN model for link prediction in a <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10000/10000-PP-Pathways.html">SNAPS protein-protein interaction network</a>.
